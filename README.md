# No.18 - Social Network API

## Lessons Learned

1. Increased familiarity and ease of use with Insomnia
2. Increased understanding of MongoDB, MongoDB seems to be friendlier than using a SQL database, atleast via the node packages we are using. 
3. I continue to be amazed at the importance neccessity of good documentation. I'm at a loss for how poor the documentation for some packages is. I don't understand how a developer could hope for strong addoption if it is difficult to gain a basic and or middling understanding of a package without having to have the knowledge and time to go through via trial and error. 

## Struggles

1. Having models and data interact/join is still not second nature to me, e.g. working reactions and friends in terms of thoughts and users, etc. 

## Things to Learn

1. Need to gain a stronger understanding of relations within the database. 


## Notation and references
A wide variet of tutorials were used to help with my understanding of the routes. I do not believe any code was directly pasted into my file as such I don't have any direct citations listed.

Files across Model 18 was used for as a good bit of starter code, I called this out at the top of files if I copy pasted a whole file in, even if I tweaked the code. I don't believe any code was simply pasted 100% without some modification. 

Video has been added, due to size limits gitHub won't allow me to link it.
